# A Elsevier LaTeX Double Columns Template

A Elsevier LaTeX Double Columns Template With RCSversion 2.3

This repository was constructed for the TSRAS group. The goal is to encourage you to publish more papers in Ocean Engineering and other excellent journals of Elsevier.

Before using this repository. If you have followed [Chinese tutorial guide](https://www.studyzzz.top/1574.html). You can compile and run the cas-dc-template.tex file directly, generating a pdf file without any errors or warnings.

We **do not recommend** that you download template from the [official website](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/els-cas-templates/). Because it cannot be compiled directly and does not meet the upload requirements of the submission system, many modifications are required.

Before writting, be sure to read the author guidelines of the journal you are submitting to. Such as [Ocean Engineering Guide for Authors](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/ocean-engineering/0029-8018/guide-for-authors).
